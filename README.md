## Translating TCA records

AiTranslate supports translation of specific fields of TCA records.It understands fields which need to be translated, only if their ``` l10n_mode ``` is set to ``` prefixLangTitle ```.

For example if you need translation of fields of tx_news (teaser and bodytext),You need to override those fields like follows:

Add it to TCA/Overrides: 
Example : ``` typo3conf/ext/theme/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tx_news_domain_model_news.php ```

```
<?php

defined('TYPO3_MODE') or die();

$GLOBALS['TCA']['tx_news_domain_model_news']['columns']['bodytext']['l10n_mode'] = 'prefixLangTitle';
$GLOBALS['TCA']['tx_news_domain_model_news']['columns']['teaser']['l10n_mode'] = 'prefixLangTitle';

```

## AI Translate Module Settings
The settings module helps to assign the sytem languages to either deepl supported languages or Google,OpenAi,Gemini,Claude languages.

For example you can assign German under Austrian German sys language if you wish. For assigning a language to a sys language you must enter itâ€™s isocode(ISO 639-1).
