What does it do?
================

This extension provides option to translate content elements and tca record fields to desired language(supported by deepl). As a fallback, Google,openai,gemini translate option is also provided as they provide support for many languages that deepl isn't providing.


For both Deepl translate and Google translate, there are two   modes-normal and autodetect, where the later autodetects source language and translates it to the desired language.
For openai and gemini autodetects source language and translates it to the desired language.
